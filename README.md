Basic Hangman game w/ user-supplied solutions.  Currently no actual hanging man.

This was basically an experiment to play around with a minimal HTML5
native-looking webapp.  My family plays hangman while waiting at restaurants,
and this is better than drawing the board in a painting app.

Installation instructions:

1. Go to http://dbushong.github.io/hangnoman/ on an Android device in Chrome
2. From the browser, choose "Add to Home Screen" and say "Add"
3. Launch game from your Android home screen

Features:

* Lets you supply your own
* Saves your gave in localStorage; offers to resume on reload
* Has a Home Screen icon
* Launches without browser chrome
* Launches landscape mode

TODO:

* iOS support
* Better non-installed play
* A man to hang?
* Networked play?
